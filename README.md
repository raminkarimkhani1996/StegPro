# StegPro
StegPro is a picture steganography tool. Using this tool, data can be embedded in the image or data can be extracted from the picture. Optionally, vigenere encryption can be performed. If the key is not entered or the key is not entered in the appropriate format, the operations will be performed without encryption using the vigenere algorithm during encryption and decryption.
