# StegPro
I developed StegPro and it is a picture steganography tool. Using this tool, data can be embedded in the image or data can be extracted from the picture. Optionally, vigenere encryption can be performed. If the key is not entered, the data is embedded in the image or extracted from the image without encryption and decryption operations.
